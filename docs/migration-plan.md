#### Schema Design

##### Knowledge Graph Schema
```cypher
// Node Types
CREATE CONSTRAINT document_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Document) REQUIRE d.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT entity_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (e:Entity) REQUIRE e.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT section_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (s:Section) REQUIRE s.id IS UNIQUE;

// Indexes for Performance
CREATE INDEX document_title IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Document) ON (d.title);
CREATE INDEX entity_text IF NOT EXISTS FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.text);
CREATE INDEX entity_type IF NOT EXISTS FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.type);
